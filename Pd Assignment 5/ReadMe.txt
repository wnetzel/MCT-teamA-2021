PD Assignment 5 by Team A
Joachim Poutaraud, Sofía González, Kristian Wentzel and Arvid Falch


All files including audio must be uploaded to the MobMuPlat folder on a phone in order to work. 
There is a folder for each patch. Here is a quick run-through of our three patches: 


THE ONDES BEEZENOT: 

Inspired by the instrument ondes martenot, Arvid's beeztisizer got upgraded for this assignment with a playable slider that plays a pitched version of the bee sample, and an oscillator
tracking the pitch and doubling it. 

It also contains a looper, with a table with the audio sample the user can select segments of which loops. This enables setting a drone sound that one can play on top of with the slider.
The playback speed of the segment is controlled with its own slider. 

The patch has controls for delay amount, reverb and delay time on the second page, as well as four pads playing short stabs for percussive use. There is also tremolo controlled by the
tilt functions of the sound, both tremolo speed and amount can be controlled. Last the full bee sample is played if the user shakes their phone.


MUSICAL BUGS:

Based on granular synthesis, the Musical Bugs MobMuPlat app is a upgraded version of Joachim's granular synth Pd patch. Here, the aim was to propose an educational tool to make field
recordings of insects and have fun with it by doing some granular synthesis.

The first page invite the user to record some insects sounds or load three different samples of insects which are integrated in the app, then the user can play with grains of insect sounds
in order to play some musical bugs tunes.

The second page allow the user to set different grain speeds (from 0.2 to 1) and specify different grain durations by pressing and holding the + and - buttons.


SUBSTRACTIVE SYNTHESIZER:

This MobMuPlat app is an upgraded version of Kristian's generative subtractive pd synth patch.

- Page 1 sports an one octave keyboard with octave shift buttons. There is a pitch tilt button, which uses the gyroscope to bend the pitch (left = lower, right = higher). It also has master volume knob, pitch bend buttons and a mod wheel controlling the amount of LFO modulating the oscillators
pitch. (Vibrato)

- Page 2 is centered around a big oscilloscope, wrapped in generative sound-control. Autoplay turns on the sequencer, and 'rnd seq' randomizes the pattern. The note range slider controls
the possible range of notes generated when the 'rnd seq' are turned on – where a low setting only generates low-pitched patterns. The speeeeeed slider controls the tempo of the sequencer,
with slight random fluctuations if the 'rnd seq' is turned on. You can also press the speed tilt button, which uses the gyroscope to control the tempo (back = slower, forth = faster). There is also an 'Init' button, initializing the whole patch including sound sculpting if pressed.

- Page 3 is where you find subtractive synth control, with a X/Y slider controlling the cutoff/resonance. There are individual attack and decay for filter and amp envelopes. The filter has
an envelope amount slider, while the amp section has a tremolo slider which controls the amount of LFO modulating the oscillator volume. Additionally there is a LFO rate slider (affecting
the vibrato and tremolo), and a FM amount slider. This page also has an oscilloscope where you can see how your sound sculpting affects the sound. Keep the autoplay turned on when
exploring this page.

ROLES:

- Arvid. He created the PD patch and MobMuplat application for the Ondes Beezenot.
- Joachim. He created the Musical Bugs PD patch and MobMuPlat application.
- Kristian. He created the Subtractive Synthesizer PD patch and MobMuPlat application.
- Sofía. She created a MobMuPlat application for one of her patches but the other patches were chosen for this assignment. She collaborated in the MobMuPlat application for the Subtractive
Synthesizer.

Everyone helped in the testing of each other's apps.
